# Runoff Model Builder

The Runoff Model Builder suite of QGIS plugin generates RORB and URBS control vector files from GIS layers for hydrological modeling.

## Description

The Runoff Model Builder automates building RORB and URBS control vector files. It takes input GIS layers representing catchment reaches, basins, centroids, and confluences and generates a control vector file for the chosed hydrology model.

RORB and URBS are hydrological models used for catchment runoff modeling in Australia and other parts of the world.

## Features

- Generate RORB and URBS control vector files from GIS layers.
- Supports the same input layer structure between plugins.
- Integrated within the QGIS processing framework.

## Installation

1. Open QGIS
2. Go to Plugins > Manage and Install Plugins
3. Search for "Runoff Model Builder"
4. Install for all model builders.

## Dependencies

This plugin requires the [Pyromb](https://github.com/norman-tom/pyromb) library to be installed in the QGIS environment.

## Usage

1. Open QGIS
2. Go to Processing Toolbox
3. Find "Build RORB, Build URBS or Build WBNM" in the algorithms list
4. Run the "Build Control Vector" algorithm
5. Select your input layers:
   - Reach layer (line features)
   - Basin layer (polygon features)
   - Centroid layer (point features)
   - Confluence layer (point features)
6. Specify the output file location
7. Run the algorithm

## Requirements

- QGIS 3.22 or later
- pyromb library (https://github.com/norman-tom/pyromb) v0.3
